	<h2>Style Placement</h2>

	<p>There are three ways to style your html document or web page :</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Inline Css :</b></li>
		<p>Inline Css means that you are styling every element individually. This is the least used method for styling as it takes so much time and is not reusable.</p>
		<p style="color: blue;font-size:25px ;">This whole paragraph is style by using inline css.</p>

		<li><b>Internal Css :</b></li>
		<p>Internal Css is used within the head tag of html file and is resuable and all the css rules are inside the style tag within the head tag.</p>
		<p>For example all the paragraphs other than the blue one are using internal css.</p>

		<li><b>External Css :</b></li>
		<p>External Css is the most used one and is the best approach for styling. IN this type we make individual file for styling and then attach that file in the head section of html page.</p>
		<p>The main heading of the page is style using external css.</p>
	</ul>
